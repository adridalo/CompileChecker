# CompileChecker - Adriano D'Alonzo

<hr></hr>

## Description
- React application where the user can upload a file and will call an external API to compile it for them
- Uses the [Hackerearth Compiler API](https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/v4/) to compile files
- Although the originating API supports a lot of languages, this application supports languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, and more!

<strong>NOTE [Pertaining to certain languages]:</strong>
- Upload only files containing a main/function in which the desired language requires to run it
- This application is meant to work with single scripts/source code files which aren't reliant/dependant on other files/modules (i.e. modularized applications will not work)
